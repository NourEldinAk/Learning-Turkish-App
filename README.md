Turkish Vocabulary Builder is an interactive application designed to help users learn over 1400 of the most frequently used words in Turkish.

To use Turkish Vocabulary Builder, you will need to have tkinter and pandas libraries installed on your machine. If you don't have these libraries, you can install them by running the following commands in your terminal:

pip install tkinter

pip install pandas

Using Turkish Vocabulary Builder is a breeze. After installing the required libraries, launch the app and start learning right away. As you go through each word, you will see two buttons under it. If you already know a word, click the ✔️ button to mark it as known and prevent it from appearing again. You have three seconds to decide whether you know the word or not. If you are unsure, the app will automatically show you the English translation of the word. In case you don't know the word, you can click the ❌ button to move to the next one. This makes it easy to learn at your own pace without getting stuck on difficult words.



Learning the most popular Turkish words can significantly enhance your communication skills when traveling or interacting with Turkish speakers. By using Turkish Vocabulary Builder, you will be able to quickly and easily master over 1400 of the most frequently used words in Turkish, helping you to confidently engage in conversations and understand native speakers."
